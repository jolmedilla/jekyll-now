This is my personal blog where I will post stuff that I find interesting for the Software Development profession and other related topics.

### Who am I?

I am a Computer Scientist by profession and education, meaning I (tightly) hold a degree in Computer Science and work as a software developer. This comes with certain drawbacks, mainly that in many situations I have to deal with co-workers who approach the software development profession from a more _rustic_ background which can be very frustrating. It is in those moments when I recall the following:

### About my name

As all spaniards I have two surnames, one from my father (Olmedilla) and one from my mother (Arregui). The name that appears in my passport is: Juan Jos√© Olmedilla Arregui. *Juan Olmedilla* is a shortening.
